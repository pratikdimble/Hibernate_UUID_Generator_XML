# Hibernate_UUID_Generator_XML
Most developers prefer numerical primary keys because they are efficient to use and easy to generate. But that doesn’t mean that a primary key has to be a number.  UUIDs, for example, have gained some popularity over the recent years. The main advantage of a UUID is its (practical) global uniqueness which provides a huge advantage for distributed systems.  If you use the typical, numerical ID that gets incremented for each new record, you need to generate all IDs by the same component of your system or the components need to communicate with each other. With a globally unique UUID, you don’t need all of this. Each component can generate a UUID and there will not be any conflicts.
